# DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF SOLID PROPELLANT â€“ BASED IGNITION TORCH FOR LPRE
This project aimed to design and develop a low-temperature solid propellant-based ignition torch for initiating combustion in liquid propellant rocket engines (LPREs). The key aspects of the project are:

1. Propellant Selection:
- Various solid propellant compositions were analyzed using software like PROPEP and CPROP to identify low-temperature (<1000K) formulations.
- Potential propellant pairs like Al/AP, KNO3/Al, Boron/AP/HTPB, Sucrose/KNO3, Sucrose/AP, Gunpowder, AP/HTPB etc. were evaluated.
- Experimental combustion testing was done to shortlist AP/HTPB and Boron/AP/HTPB as the selected propellant formulations.

2. Propellant Grain Fabrication:
- The selected propellant compositions were mixed with binders, curing agents, plasticizers etc.
- Different grain geometries like end-burn, tubular etc. were considered, with end-burn grains being selected.
- Five major propellant grain samples were fabricated with varying dimensions and compositions.

3. Igniter Selection: 
- Different igniter compositions like AP/Al/matchstick, C/S/AP, glycerin/matchstick, kerosene gel/matchstick were tested.
- Kerosene gel/matchstick and plain matchstick powder were selected as suitable igniters.

4. Hardware Design & Fabrication:
- Nozzles with varying throat diameters (3.5mm, 4.5mm, 5.5mm) were designed in CATIA and fabricated.
- A combustion chamber was designed and fabricated with ports for pressure, temperature sensing and ignition.

5. Test Bed Setup:
- A test bed was set up with the combustion chamber/nozzle assembly.
- Pressure sensors and thermocouples were integrated for data acquisition.
- Both horizontal and vertical test orientations were used.

6. Integrated Testing & Results:
- 5 major hot tests were conducted by igniting the propellant grains inside the chamber.
- Parameters like mass flow rates, burn rates, pressures, temperatures were measured.
- Results were analyzed, with the experimental burn rate compared against theoretical curves.

The key deliverables were the low-temperature AP/HTPB and Boron/AP/HTPB propellant formulations, fabricated grains, nozzles, combustion chamber and a functional test bed setup. The project demonstrated their suitability for potential applications like LPRE ignition.
